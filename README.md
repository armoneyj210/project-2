- [Trello](https://trello.com/b/CI47wR0L/project-2-marvel-vs-dc)

- [ GitHub](https://github.com/armoneyj210/project-2)

- [ Deploy-App](https://enigmatic-oasis-06808.herokuapp.com/comic/)

This is a full stack app for cataloguing and editing your favorite Marvel and Dc characters, creators, and the two universes.

It contains three RESTful routes with the models:

- Creator

- Characters

- Universes

The app also uses the following:

- HTML

- CSS

- JavaScript

- Node.js

- Express.js

- Mongoose

- MongoDB.js

The app is publicly accessible, so security is non-existant. moving forward I would like to add user names and accounts equipped with login.
